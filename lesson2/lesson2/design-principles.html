            <p>For me, this site uses the principle of proximity, as the elements are closer together. When we see
                design elements close together within a composition, we perceive those elements as related. That's why
                when I see these elements organized in this way I can recognize the proximity principle.

            <p>In this page I can clearly see the principle of repetition, as an element is being repeated several
                times, which creates a feeling of organized movement and consistency within a composition. In turn, it
                creates an intrusion to promote the effectiveness of the product, which I believe is in other words, a
                marketing strategy, which gives more prestige and recognition to the site.</p>

            </div>
            <p>By analyzing the Github page, I was able to recognize which are the elements that allow it to comply with
                the principle of alignment, since people tend to scan pages, they must be designed in a certain way, for
                example, being in a language that reads from left to right, everything must be organized that way.
                That's why, through a good use of alignment, a layout will look neat, clean and readable to the
                audience.</p>
